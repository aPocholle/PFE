2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_74_system_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_150_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_74_system_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_150_system_clk_wiz_0_0]

Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin system_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks clk_74_system_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_150_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.

There is a large setup violation of -5.434 ns between system_i/proc_sys_reset_0/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_74_system_clk_wiz_1_0) and system_i/v_axi4s_vid_out_0/inst/COUPLER_INST/generate_async_fifo.FIFO_INST/XPM_FIFO_ASYNC_INST/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg/ENARDEN (clocked by clk_150_system_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
